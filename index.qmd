## Introduction {#sec-intro}

Dryland regions, encompassing arid, semi-arid, hyper-arid, and dry sub-humid systems, account for 40% of the Earthâ€™s land surface. They are home to approximately 2 billion people worldwide and represent the largest terrestrial biome (**iucn-drylands-2019)**. Despite supporting diverse ecosystems and human populations, dryland regions face mounting challenges exacerbated by increasing urbanization, expanding agricultural activities, and climate-induced amplification of precipitation patterns [@taylor2013]. This water scarcity is intensifying due to the compounding effects of climate variability and increased groundwater extraction [@taylor2013]. In drylands, groundwater serves as a vital resource for sustaining ecosystems and meeting human needs [@scanlon2006; @yao2018].

Base flow is the sustained portion of streamflow in the absence of runoff that is derived from groundwater discharge **(usgs-glossary-2018).** Base flow is critical to maintaining seasonal low-flow regimes, supporting aquatic ecosystems, and facilitating the transport of nutrients and chemicals. Base-flow contribution to streamflow can be highly variable spatially [@singh2018; @bosch2017; @beck2013], and temporally [@ficklin2016; @tan2020]. Increasing groundwater extraction, changes in land cover/land use, and changes in precipitation patterns due to climate change affect the timing and volumes of base flow [@tan2020; @taylor2013]. Effective management of water quantity and quality depends on understanding seasonal and interannual base flow patterns and long-term changes in base flow behavior.
